> Our final project -- **Optimizing Caffe**
The first two homework are quite naive, but they gave us a basic feeling of parallel programming, especially using CUDA to write kernel functions. The ability of writing high-performanced CUDA kernel functions, as our teacher said, decides whether you can get a satisfying offer!

And our final project is quite difficult. As we all know, Caffe is a state-of-art deep-learning structure. Though tensorflow and pytorch are more frequently used these years, you have to adimitted Caffe is an awesome structure producing its own system of deep learning, getting rather high performance with the help of CUDA kernel functions, cudnn and cublas library, all designed by NVIDIA, and letting deep-learning learners easy to use. Since we are still working on this project, our modified code will be pushed later(on about Jan 5th, 2020, our project deadline).
